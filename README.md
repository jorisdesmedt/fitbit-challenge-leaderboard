A clock face to monitor fitbit challenges

A clock face that can be used to live monitor your fitbit step challenges.

Click the watch to cycle through the following items:

* The person right behind you in the challenge

## Progress bars
The green progress bar shows the relative number of steps you are behind the player before you on the leaderboard. The fuller the progress bar the closer you are to catch him up.
The oragne progress bar shows the distance between you and the player right behind you on the leaderboard. The smaller the progress bar the further you are away from him.
